My name is Oluwasegun Ojo. I am currently a Research Assistant at IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, where I currently work on various statistics and data analytics project like outlier detection,  data modelling etc. I studied Statistics at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria and Mathematics at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Cameroon. 

I started this blog to document my adventures in becoming a data scientist and also to share my learning experiences. I am a big fan of R and it's my favourite for making sense of data.  I constantly use the `tidyverse` suite of packages and I plan to learn how to create  interactive data visualisations using the `shiny` framework in R.  I like documenting my data analysis workflow with using Rmarkdown which is why I find `blogdown` the perfect framework for making this blog. 

I find myself using Python sometimes but I plan to build more competence. I hope that this blog will help me with that. I have a lot of interest in machine learning and especially Deep Learning. Since I just started learning ML and DL myself, I will be writing a lot of posts and tutorials about these as I believe that writing is one of the best ways to deepen my understanding of new concepts. Consequently, posts will be about topics ranging from R, stats, maths, data analysis to machine learning, deep learning and (maybe) even artificial intelligence. 

Formally, I was a freelance data analyst on [**Upwork**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c88a1d3bf29573d2) where I helped clients tackle difficult data wrangling projects and to make sense of their data. Nowadays, I am working on completeing my PhD in the Mathematical Engineering program of the Carlos 3 University of Madrid (UC3M).
