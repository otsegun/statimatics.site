I am Oluwasegun Taiwo Ojo. I grew up in [Akure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akure), Nigeria, a town in south-western Nigeria. I have always wanted to be a professor for as long as I can remember, even before I knew what professors do. I just wanted to be like my father's friend who was a professor at the university in my town, the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA). 

I ended up studying statistics at the same university after which I got an [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences Next Einstein Initiative](https://nexteinstein.org/) (AIMS-NEI) scholarship to do a master's degree in mathematical sciences at the AIMS centre in [Cameroon](https://aims-cameroon.org/). I finished at AIMS-Cameroon in 2016 and freelanced a bit as data analyst on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c88a1d3bf29573d2) where I helped clients tackle some difficult data wrangling and analysis projects.  


Currently, I am Research Assistant at [IMDEA Networks Institute](https://www.networks.imdea.org/) in Leganes, Madrid, and a Mathematical Engineering Ph.D. student at the [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](uc3m.es). My research focus mainly on outlier detection methods and tools used in functional data analysis (FDA). 


I am a big fan of R and it's my favourite software for processing data. I have recently been dabbling into a bit of C++ too because of it's speed and memory management. I also love reading about stats and maths and tinkering with computers. Below you can find a couple of current projects I am involved in:

### Detecting and Classifying Outliers in Big Functional Data.
A manuscript describing a scalable method (called FastMUOD) to detect and classify outliers in functional data. 
(Under review: [Arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07287)).

### CoronaSurveys Project
I am involved in the [CoronaSurveys project](https://coronasurveys.org/) led by my supervisor [Antonio Fernandez Anta](http://people.networks.imdea.org/~antonio_fernandez/) at IMDEA Networks. A brief overview of CoronaSurveys can be 
found in our KDD Humanitarian Mapping Workshop 2020 paper on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12783.pdf).

## R package
I am currently building an R package for some functional data analysis methods.
