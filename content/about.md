# About 

I am Oluwasegun Taiwo Ojo. I am currently a Research Assistant at IMDEA Networks Institute, Leganes, Madrid, and an Mathematical Engineering Ph.D Student at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. My research focus mainly on outlier detection methods and tool used functional data analysis. 

Before now, I completed a bachelor's degree in statistics at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria and Mathematics at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Cameroon and then worked a bit as a freelance data analyst on [**Upwork**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c88a1d3bf29573d2) where I helped clients tackle some difficult data wrangling projects and to make sense of their data. 


I am a big fan of R and it's my favourite software for making sense of data. I also love reading about stats and maths. You can check out my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CtT5unQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)  to follow some of my latest projects.
