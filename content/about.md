I am Oluwasegun, a statistician and an aspiring data scientist. I earned my bachelor's degree in statistics from the Federal University of Technology, Akure and my master's degree in  mathematics from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Cameroon. My master's degree thesis was on analysis of satellite radiation data. I am a big fan of R and it's my favourite for making sense of data. I have been doing data analysis in R for about 3 years now.  I constantly use packages like ggplot2, plotly, (for data visualizations), forecast, ts, (for time series analysis), lme4, (for linear mixed effect modelling), etc. I have created  interactive web-based data applications using the shiny framework in R and I regularly create dynamic reports using Rmarkdown. I find myself using python sometimes and I am conversant with popular libraries like numpy, scipy, pandas and scikit-learn. 

Recently decided to be a data scientist, with a focus on big data analysis and machine learning. I created this blog to serve as a journal/portfolio of my adventures in data science. Posts will be about topics ranging from stats and data analysis to machine learning, deep learning, neural network and even artificial intelligence. 

I am currently a freelance data scientist on [**Fiverr**](https://www.fiverr.com/segunojo) and [**Upwork**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c88a1d3bf29573d2) and I basically help clients make sense of data from various fields in social science, finance, health, science, e-commerce etc. Feel free to check out my [**Data Analysis using R**](https://www.fiverr.com/segunojo/do-any-data-analysis-work-using-r?funnel=1383b409-a7b5-4d53-ab41-c72a754f7b29) gig on Fiverr or shoot me a message on my [**Upwork profile**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c88a1d3bf29573d2)  if you need help with any data science and analysis task.  I'm also open to remote data science internships and you can contact me on my [**email**](mailto:statimatician@gmail.com) if you have a position.
