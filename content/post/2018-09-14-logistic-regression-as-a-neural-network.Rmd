### Introduction

This post continues my blog series on Neural Networks and Deep Learning with (an) R (twist), which is motivated by my current enrollment in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera. One of the very first things I picked in this course is that the familiar logistic regression classifiers can be seen as a neural network. In fact it turns out that the logistic regression classifier is a good example to illustrate and motivate the basics of neural networks. I start by motivating the binary classification problem.

### The Binary Classification Problem
The binary classification problem is one in which given a set of input $X$ (called features), we want to output a binary prediction $y$. A fascinating example of this type of problem I saw recently is given a set of (some Nike and Adidas) shoe pictures, can we learn a binary classifier to tell whether a shoe was made by Nike or Adidas!

$$X \rightarrow y$$ 

$$(shoe\ image\ pixel\ values) \rightarrow shoe\ is\ Nike\ or\ Adidas$$


In this setting, the possible outputs (Nike/Adidas) of $y$ are denoted with $0$ and $1$ and the logistic regression classifier is typically used on this type of problem because it is capable of producing an output (prediction)  which is the probability that $y = 1$ given the input features $X$: $(P(y=1|X)$
