<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This post continues my blog series on Neural Networks and Deep Learning with (an) R (twist), which is motivated by my current enrollment in Andrew Ngâ€™s Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera. One of the very first things I picked in this course is that the familiar logistic regression classifiers can be seen as a neural network. In fact it turns out that the logistic regression classifier is a good example to illustrate and motivate the basics of neural networks. I start by motivating the binary classification problem.</p>

<h3>The Binary Classification Problem</h3>
<p>The binary classification problem is one in which given a set of input <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (called features), we want to output a binary prediction <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. A fascinating example of this type of problem I saw recently is given a set of (some Nike and Adidas) shoe pictures, can we learn a binary classifier to tell whether a shoe was made by Nike or Adidas!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X \rightarrow y\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(shoe\ image\ pixel\ values) \rightarrow shoe\ is\ Nike\ or\ Adidas\]</span></p>
<p>In this setting, the possible outputs (Nike/Adidas) of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are denoted with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and the logistic regression classifier is typically used on this type of problem because it is capable of producing an output (prediction) which is the probability that <span class="math inline">\(y = 1\)</span> given the input features <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\((P(y=1|X)\)</span></p>
